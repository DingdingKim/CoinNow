## 🔔🌟 Update 1.6.1 (2018.02.20) 🌟🔔
- 영어로 적기가 너무 힘들어요ㅠ 기능은 문제 없지만 중간중간 한글로 주석달린 부분도 있고 정리되지 못한 부분들이 있을 수 있습니다ㅠ 죄송합니다 ㅠ 차차 정리할게요 ㅠ
- 첨에 무료로 배포하고 기부로 수익을 조금이나마 내볼참이었는데 기부금은 0원이고ㅜ 무료 서버도 간당간당하고해서ㅜ 지금은 앱스토어에서 유료로 판매하고 있습니다ㅜ
  유료로 전환한 뒤로는 깃헙 업뎃을 안하고있다가ㅠ 깃헙에 올린다고 앱결제율에 크게 영향이 있을것같지도않아서 앞으로 앱스토어 업데이트 할때마다 깃헙에도 푸시할 예정입니다!

## To users ❤️ (Update note ..Not important 😅)
As coins and exchanges increase, it's too narrow to fit in the popup.
How do you at a glance! Do not be mad! neatly! I'm worried about whether I can show you!

In the next major update, I will return to add function, not to add exchanges or coins!
An alarm at a fixed price or something visual so you can better understand the change in the price!
Actually, I do not make money with this app, but because I am so funny and need to make an app, it may be a little slower and you may not feel uncomfortable.
You have a suggestion or something to say about Coinnow! 
Request issues in Github or send an e-mail to me. I'll reply you ASAP :D hehe

Every time I leave work and start working until dawn, I'm almost out of my mind and I am writing down the update notes! Hehe
I hope Coinow will help you a little bit!
Obviously users do not have much to read this update note to the end, but ~
Please do a lot of Coinnow promotion ~ I love you users!
